# Anomaly Detection with ECG data

# Overview:

This project was created to be able to distinguise normal heartbeats with anomaly heartbeats using Long Short Term Memmory (LSTM) Autoencoder. 

# Features: 

- The script presents quick data analysis of the data. 
- Preparing data for training and testing LSTM algorithm.
- Algorithm is well noted with every singles steps (for learning purposes).
- Code can be modified with difference batch sizes. 

# Running The Project
- Project can be clone and run easily on collab with minor changing on connection from google drive to collab.
